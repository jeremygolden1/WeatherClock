# WeatherClock
Displays time and weather (currently only updates weather on run, time correctly updates)

Work in progress

Need to update atleast once every minute (perhaps more for clock)

You need to input an API key and city code for the script to run.

You may also need Digital-7 font, or just edit script to different font for clock.
